title: How To Get The Most Out Of Your Coding Bootcamp Experience
---
Have you decided to go to a coding bootcamp? You can read more about how to decide if going to a coding bootcamp is right for you in [this](/2017/08/25/coding-bootcamps.html) article on my blog. If you've asked yourself the most important questions and have decided that the best way to move forward in your programming journey is to attend a coding bootcamp, now you're probably asking yourself how you can get the most out of your experience. Here are three concepts we'll take the time to look at in turn.

 1. Preparedness
 2. Consistency
 3. Applying Yourself
 
The first item on the list is preparedness. It's important to make sure you're prepared for your experience or you might not achieve the success you envisioned originally. When I first decided that I really was going to go to a coding bootcamp, even though I hadn't decided on which specific one, I began asking as many questions as I could. I asked my developer friends, industry professionals of both tech related and non related fields, and staff of several bootcamps, trying to understand:
 * What kind of people the competetive bootcamps are looking for
 * What are the characteristics of the people who succeed in their programs
 * What skills will be essential to my success in this program
 
The answers to these questions I knew would be essential to my success at a coding bootcamp. It might be helpful for you to ask the same questions yourself. If you know what the expectations of the bootcamp is going into it, you can work to improve in the areas where you need work and be well prepared when your first session starts. 

So your first week has come and gone. The hype has died away and now you're settling into the daily grind. Your greatest weapon during this phase will be consistency. Needless to say, you'll need to sacrifice parties, going out with friends, video games etc. Don't forget why you entered the bootcamp in the first place. The tuition on most of the bootcamps should be enough to keep you motivated, but in case you're tempted to slack a little today and pick up where you left off tomorrow, I recommend that you set a goal for yourself. Do a certain number of checkpoints, challenges or assignments each and every day. Push yourself to your limits and do it consistently. This is the only way you can make a big change in a short amount of time, which is the whole idea of bootcamps.

Applying yourself is something you can do even before your bootcamp starts. Apply yourself in your studies, but equally as important is to apply yourself in your job search (assuming your goal is to get hired after the bootcamp). Bloc.io has been really impressive so far in the way it is results oriented. Before I finished even my first month (it's a six month program) one of the assignments was to chose a location where I'd like to work in the future and identify 30 companies hiring for positions in those areas. Then I had to determine the technologies used and the industries those companies were a part of. Things like this really help to visualize your end goal. 

If your program does this, that's fantastic! But there are many things you ca do yourself too. For example, networking and internships are a huge part of getting a job in the future. If your program is very intense, this may not apply to you, but in my case Bloc.io only offers a part time track for Web Development which is my area of interest. Since it was part time, I have some extra time each week and I began looking for ways to spend it that would help me in the aftermath of the program. I began looking for companies in my locale that were involved in tech and web development. A few emails and a phonecall later and I began an internship at a local tech company that I think will give me a huge advantage when I'm seeking a job in the future when comparing me to other junior developers who don't have this experience.

Granted, I was very lucky to find that position, but if you don't try to find something like that, you'll never know what kind of opportunities are out there. I think if you make an effort to be prepared, consistent in your efforts and apply yourself to succeed, you will make the most out of your coding bootcamp experience.
