Schizophrenia is a mental disorder that is characterized by a mental split from reality. 

Its 3 most common symptoms are:

 * Disorganized thinking; delusions

 Schizophrenia most commonly develops during early adulthood between the ages of 15 and 25 (although the rates are different for men and for women, see image 1.1)

The development and course of schizophrenia varies widely from case to case. There are 4 classifications for these variations:
 * 22%: One episode only â€“ no impairment
 * 35%: Several episodes with no or minimal impairment
 * 8%: Impairment after the first episode with subsequent exacerbation and no return to normality
 * 35%: Impairment increasing with each of several episodes and no return to normality

This means that in a city of 3 million, there are likely to be 21,000 people suffering from schizophrenia. 
Worldwide there is a 1% diagnosis rate.
