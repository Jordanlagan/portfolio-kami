title: Coding Bootcamps - Are They Really Worth It?
---
Are Coding Bootcamps worth attending? More importantly, are they worth your wallet? Let’s look at some pros and cons to see if that hefty price tag is really going to turn you into a developer in a few short weeks.
Is it really possible to go from zero prior knowledge to a coding master in 3 – 6 months?

Short answer is no. Definitely not a master. That’s just common sense. Any coding bootcamp which promises you this is flat out lying. It takes years of practice, consistent work and never-ending learning to become an expert in anything. What is most certainly possible however, is to obtain a foundation of knowledge which, if the hard work and consistency is put in, can lead to many opportunities which would have been impossible otherwise.
 
The kind of coding bootcamp you should be keeping on your list is the one that have clearly presented success strategies for you to land a job immediately or soon after your graduation. A coding bootcamp should be results oriented from day 1. Ask yourself what kind of ways do they claim to prepare you for success in the job search? The key to discovering the worth of a coding bootcamp is to realize what kind of things they promise. Nothing short of results will cut it. You want the knowledge or you want a job. You don’t need a good experience. If the only thing you’ll get out of attending that bootcamp is a bunch of new friends, it’s not worth spending the money for a ‘networking’ experience. That brings me to my next point.


**Read the reviews**


The internet opens up new opportunities for people everywhere. The only way you are reading this blog post right now is through a computer that is connected someway or another to the internet and to my website. If you are reading this post, you are clearly interested in web development. But the internet isn’t just a tool for digesting information or being a consumer, it’s a powerful tool, so please use it!
If a bootcamp doesn’t have any detailed reviews online on third party websites like stack overflow or reddit,  it gets into the realm of scammy and that’s not a place I like to put my money. 

Before I decided to attend Bloc.io (I’m currently just out of my first month) I read review after review of many in person and online bootcamps. A coding bootcamp shouldn’t have less than 4 stars. If anything less than 80% of the reviews are excited young developers raving about the amazing experiences their having out in the real world working on real projects, that means that 20% of the student body attending that institution were somehow dissatisfied with their experience (best case scenario), or the faculty in charge did something a little mean or underhanded to keep only those likely of success in their program to preserve their precious 95% employment rates (worst case scenario).  

The point here is to keep a clear mind, and don’t be swayed by the big numbers on the company’s landing page. Just like exercise, spending more money on fancy workout equipment won’t make you lose more weight! There’s a fair price to pay for curriculum and for instruction. The most important part is getting paired with a program in which the people you’re paying are invested in your success. That can be hard to determine from the surface, so my advice is to do your homework, dig up the dirt on each program on your list, and talk to as many graduates and faculty in that program as you can.
