A warm hello!

My name is Jordan Lagan. I'm a young guy who loves making cool stuff with awesome technology. I drink too much coffee.

My favorite foods (in no particular order):
 * PIZZA
 * Sushi
 * Okonomiyaki
 * Ramen
 * Hamburgers
 * Buffalo Wings
 * Udon
 * McDonald's Breakfast Sandwich
 * タコわさび
 * Quesadillas
 * Tacos

I like making and listening to music, writing stories, playing video games, reading fantasy and mystery books, skipping dinner and going straight to desert, studying other cultures and other languages, etc. I like to think I'm pretty adventurous. I have lots of Minecraft war stories.
