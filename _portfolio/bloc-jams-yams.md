## Explanation

Bloc Jams / Bloc Yams is a Spotify clone with responsive design that features a landing page, a collection list page, and an individual album page. The album page allows you to select a song manually with the mouse and play it or to control with the overlaying player bar which allows you to toggle play and pause, and switch to the next song or the previous song. 

## Problem

Spotify and other sites like it can often be hard to use and them contain many more features than are needed for those who seek a simple music listening experience. Bloc Jams / Bloc Yams provides essentially that as a no-frills no-ads alternative.

## Solution

To make a Spotify clone with the same essential functionality of musical giants like Spotify or Pandora, I had to question what features are absolutely necessary, and cut out everything else. There are no search features, playlists, or other albums, but you can listen to the 5 songs available on Bloc Jams / Bloc Yams all you want, in any order with no ads and even on mobile!

## Results

In my opinion, the results speak for themselves. 

> The results speak for themselves - My opinion

Bloc Jams / Bloc Yams was meant to be a practice for me as I begin learning Web Development through Bloc.io, and I would say I learned a great deal. Some of the things I learned include:
 * Including CSS and Javascript into an HTML file
 * Understanding a viewport and the essentials of responsive design
 * Creating and using HTML tables
 * Using media queries 
 * Basic understanding of DOM manipulation through vanilla JS and jQuery
 * Basic CSS animations
 * Turning HTMl into a dynamic JavaScript template
 * Including and using an external library

## Conclusion

As a learning experience, Bloc Jams / Bloc Yams taught me many foundational programming and web development concepts; as a music player, it is certainly lacking in most of the components that would make it usable and/or beneficial. Nevertheless, I am proud of it as my first project.
